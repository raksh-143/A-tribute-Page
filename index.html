    <h1>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img src="./assets/mainImg.jpg" alt="Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam" width="249.7" height="295.3" />
    <p>
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of
        India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
        engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
        Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was 
        intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus
        came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and 
        launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in 
        India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

    <h2>Early Life</h2>

    <p>
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage
        centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. 
        His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was
        a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the
        now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.

    <h2>Education</h2>

    <p>
        In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had
        a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics. After completing his 
        education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's
        College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics
        in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. While
        Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and 
        threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met
        the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to
        meet a difficult deadline". He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed
        ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.

    <h2>Work as a Scientist</h2>

    <p>
        After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development
        Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government
        of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He 
        started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.
        Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.
        1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director 
        of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in 
        near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at 
        DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more 
        engineers.

    <h2>Work as a President</h2>

    <p>
        Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential 
        election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term 
        lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007.During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the 
        People's President, saying that signing the Office of Profit Bill was the toughest decision he had taken 
        during his tenure. Kalam was criticised for his inaction in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy 
        petitions submitted to him during his tenure. Article 72 of the Constitution of India empowers the 
        President of India to grant pardons, and suspend or commute the death sentence of convicts on death row.
        Kalam acted on only one mercy plea in his five-year tenure as president, rejecting the plea of rapist 
        Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged. Perhaps the most notable plea was from Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri 
        terrorist who was convicted of conspiracy in the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament and was 
        sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004. While the sentence was scheduled to be carried 
        out on 20 October 2006, the pending action on his mercy plea resulted in him remaining on death row.
        He also took the controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.

        On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at 
        the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some 
        discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five 
        minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical 
        condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the 
        intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST. His last words, 
        to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"
